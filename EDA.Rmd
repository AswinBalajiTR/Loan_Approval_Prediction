# **Data Loading and Basic Exploration:**

```{r}
df=read.csv("Loan.csv")

#head
head(df)

#tail
tail(df)
```
# **Data Types, Schema and Summary:**
```{r}
#Shape
cat("Row Count :",dim(df)[1],", Column Count :",dim(df)[2],'\n\n')

#Structure of the data
str(df)
cat('\n\n')


#Summary Statistics
summary(df)
cat('\n\n')

#Unique value counts in every columns
for (col in colnames(df)){
    cat(col, ": ", length(unique(df[[col]])), "\n")

```

# **Checking Data Quality:**
```{r}
#Converting relevvant variables as factor

# **Variable Analysis and Relationship**

1.	What are the strongest predictors of loan approval or rejection?

```{r}
#correlation matrix
cor_matrix <- cor(df[, sapply(df, is.numeric)])

# Melt the correlation matrix for plotting
melted_cor_matrix <- melt(cor_matrix)

# Correlation heatmap
ggplot(melted_cor_matrix, aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(color = "black") +
  scale_fill_gradient2(low = "green", high = "violet", mid = "white", midpoint = 0, limit = c(-1, 1)) +
  labs(title = "Correlation Heatmap", x = "", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1),axis.text.y = element_text(vjust = 0, hjust=1))

```
Annual income,Risk Score, TotalDebtToIncomeRatio, Annual Income and Monthly Income are the highly correlated variables with that of loan approval.

2.	How does debt-to-income ratio impact loan approval, interest rates, and risk scores?
```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(ggplot2)

# Calculate correlations
cor_risk <- cor(df$DebtToIncomeRatio, df$RiskScore, use = "complete.obs")
cor_interest <- cor(df$DebtToIncomeRatio, df$InterestRate, use = "complete.obs")
cor_loan <- cor(df$DebtToIncomeRatio, df$LoanApproved, use = "complete.obs")

# Print correlation results
cat("Correlation with Risk Score:", round(cor_risk, 2), "\n")
cat("Correlation with Interest Rate:", round(cor_interest, 2), "\n")
cat("Correlation with Loan Approved:", round(cor_loan, 2), "\n")

# Scatter plots with linear trendlines
# Risk Score vs Debt-to-Income Ratio
ggplot(df, aes(x = RiskScore, y = DebtToIncomeRatio)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkblue") +

       y = "Debt-to-Income Ratio") +
  theme_minimal()

# Interest Rate vs Debt-to-Income Ratio
ggplot(df, aes(x = InterestRate, y = DebtToIncomeRatio)) +
  geom_point(color = "red") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkred") +
  labs(title = "Interest Rate vs Debt-to-Income Ratio",
       x = "Interest Rate",
       y = "Debt-to-Income Ratio") +

       y = "Debt-to-Income Ratio",
       fill = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Approved", "Not Approved"))




# Linear regression models
# Regression for Risk Score
model_risk <- lm(DebtToIncomeRatio ~ RiskScore, data = df)
summary(model_risk)

# Regression for Interest Rate
model_interest <- lm(DebtToIncomeRatio ~ InterestRate, data = df)
summary(model_interest)

```
3.	What are the financial and demographic profiles of high-risk versus low-risk applicants?


```{r}
# Plot RiskScore vs Age
ggplot(df, aes(x =RiskScore , y = Age)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = EmploymentStatus), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Risk Score vs Age", x = "Age", y = "Risk Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Employed" = "grey", "Self-Employed" = "green", "Unemployed" = "#2993ae"))

  geom_point(aes(color = EmploymentStatus), size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Risk Score vs Experience", x = "Experience (Years)", y = "Risk Score") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Employed" = "grey", "Self-Employed" = "green", "Unemployed" = "#2993ae"))

4.	How does credit score impact interest rates, loan approval, and loan amount?
```{r}
# Categorizing Risk Levels
df$risk_category <- ifelse(df$RiskScore < 40, "Low Risk",
                                  ifelse(df$RiskScore > 50, "High Risk", "Medium Risk"))

#credit score vs Loan Approved
ggplot(df, aes(x = as.factor(LoanApproved), y = CreditScore)) +
  geom_bin2d(bins = 50) +  # Increases bin resolution for better detail
  scale_fill_gradient(low = "pink", high = "#2993ce") +
  labs(title = "Heatmap of CreditScore vs Loan Approved",
       x = "Loan Approved",
       y = "CreditScore",
       fill = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_x_discrete(labels = c("Approved", "Not Approved"))

ggplot(df, aes(x = CreditScore, y = InterestRate)) +
  geom_point(color = "blue") +

ggplot(df, aes(x = CreditScore, y = LoanAmount)) +
  geom_point(color = "green") +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = TRUE, color = "darkgreen") +
  labs(title = "CreditScore vs LoanAmount",
       x = "CreditScore",
       y = "LoanAmount") +
  theme_minimal()

# Summarizing Demographic and Financial Features by Risk Category
summary_stats <- df %>%
  group_by(risk_category) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_income = mean(AnnualIncome, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_loan_amount = mean(LoanAmount, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_age = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_dependents = mean(NumberOfDependents, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_credit_score = mean(CreditScore, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(summary_stats)

# Credit Score Impact Analysis
impact_analysis <- df %>%
  summarise(
    correlation_interest_rate = cor(CreditScore, InterestRate, use = "complete.obs"),
    correlation_loan_amount = cor(CreditScore, LoanAmount, use = "complete.obs"),
    approval_rate_high_score = mean(LoanApproved[CreditScore >= 700], na.rm = TRUE),
    approval_rate_low_score = mean(LoanApproved[CreditScore < 700], na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(impact_analysis)

```

5.	What is the relationship between loan purpose and repayment behavior, and how does it affect risk?
```{r}
# Cross-tabulation of Loan Purpose and LoanApproved
repayment_behavior <- df %>%
  group_by(LoanPurpose, risk_category) %>%
  summarise(
    avg_repayment_rate = mean(LoanApproved, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_interest_rate = mean(InterestRate, na.rm = TRUE),
    avg_loan_amount = mean(LoanAmount, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
print(repayment_behavior)

# Visualizing the relationship (optional)
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(repayment_behavior, aes(x = LoanPurpose, y = avg_repayment_rate, fill = risk_category)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  labs(title = "Repayment Behavior by Loan Purpose and Risk Category", x = "Loan Purpose", y = "Repayment Rate") +
  theme_minimal()
